    | People often tweet, unaware that theyâ€™re sharing their location (a feature which is active by default on smartphones); even those that are aware of this fact make the assumption that while the information is public, it is harmless. However over time behavioural patterns can be inferred and mapped, this information can be used for ill intent.
