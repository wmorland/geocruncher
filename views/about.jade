  h2 The Case for Caution
  p Social media brings us closer to our friends and loved ones, but also closer to people we might want to avoid. Everyone has experienced the new variety of awkward interactions the internet affords us, unwanted comments, likes, re-tweets, follows and the unexpected scrutiny of our increasingly public private lives; so it should come as no surprise that when caution fails, and a services security measures are breached, things can go very badly.
  p What people often ignore however, is the extent to which they themselves are at fault for their exposure. While social media services have a duty to safeguard the information of their users, and even to advise them on how to safely use their services; they are also under a lot of pressure to provide users with as much freedom as possible, and when a user fails to recognise the consequences of their choices, they can unwittingly place themselves at serious risk.
  p We hope to call people’s attention to the extent of their consented exposure, that is, how much information is freely accessible on social media, because of their decisions as users. As an example, we’ve built a tool that allows people to use publicly available geo-tagged tweets to create a map that plots the locations of the user’s latest tweets or plot tweets from a random third party, whose details are omitted for security. (This feature exists to allow people without twitter accounts to use the website and to show the extent to which this is a problem).
  p Some might wonder what harm could come from their location being publicly known, or from a trail being mapped, but increasingly this sort of data has been used in the commission of crimes against people’s property, and even their personal well-being.
  p Even in the early days of geo-locational features on social media, the possibilities for abuse were widely recognised by both concerned parties and those hoping to exploit them. Criminals had already been using social media posts to track victim’s movements and habits before the introduction of geo-tagging, but now anyone who regularly checks-in will be creating a map of their habits which can be analysed and understood almost instantly, without the need for much “detective” work on the part of potential thieves, stalkers or kidnappers.
  p This problem was previously exposed by pleaserobme.com and icanstalku.com, sites which had to shut down because even though they only intended to expose this phenomenon, they unwittingly facilitated the abuse of this technology. 
  p We hope to revive their message in a safer format, by allowing people to only observe maps generated from completely random twitter accounts or their own (via log-in).
